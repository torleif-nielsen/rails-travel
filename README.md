# Rails Travel

The companion GitBook can be found here: [Rails 5 Basics](https://www.gitbook.com/book/torleif-nielsen/rails-5-basics/details)

This is the repository containing the most up to date source code following a book I am writing as an introduction to developing web applications using **Ruby on Rails**. The demo app itself is a travel web application and the goals of the book are to introduce concepts like server side rendering with Ruby, some client side rendering with JavaScript, HTML, CSS frameworks (Bootstrap in this case), and responsive, accessible design.
